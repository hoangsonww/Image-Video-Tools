            <h2>About Image & Video Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Image & Video Tools was born out of a passion for making powerful media editing accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background. What started as a simple image resizer has grown into a fully featured, browser-based suite that empowers creators, educators, marketers, and hobbyists to take control of their visual content without ever installing software. Built by Son Nguyen in early 2024, this platform reflects a commitment to intuitive design, thoughtful performance optimizations, and full privacy—your files stay local to your device unless you choose otherwise.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Philosophy & Approach</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that editing should be a seamless extension of creativity, not a frustrating obstacle. That’s why every tool in our collection is designed with minimal clicks and immediate feedback in mind. We focus on progressive enhancement: core features work on all modern browsers, while advanced capabilities leverage WebAssembly and Service Workers for offline support and near-native speeds.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Offline & Progressive Web App</h2>
            <p>
                Image & Video Tools installs easily as a Progressive Web App, letting you launch it from your home screen or desktop just like a native app. Thanks to Service Worker caching, you can even work offline once the site has been loaded. Whether you’re on a flight or in a remote location, your editing workflow remains uninterrupted.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Security & Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Your media is yours alone. All processing occurs entirely on your device—no uploads, no third-party servers, and no data collection. We adhere to modern security practices and submit our code to regular audits to ensure that your files and browser environment remain secure at all times.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Accessibility & Inclusivity</h2>
            <p>
                We’re committed to making Image & Video Tools usable by everyone. Every control is fully keyboard-navigable, all meaningful visuals include alt text, and contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards. We continually refine our interface based on user feedback and accessibility audits to ensure no one is left behind.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Supported Media & Formats</h2>
            <p>
                From JPEG and PNG to BMP, WEBP, and TIFF for images, to MP4, MOV, and WebM for videos, we support the formats you encounter every day. Our converter and filter tools handle both static and animated content, while the thumbnail generator and sound remover work seamlessly across a variety of codecs and container types.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Case Studies & Testimonials</h2>
            <p>
                Photographers use our batch resize and watermark features to streamline client deliverables. Educators create on-the-fly video previews for lecture slides. E-commerce teams generate product thumbnails and apply consistent branding automatically. “A lifesaver when I had to crop and compress hundreds of images before a launch,” says Maria A., a digital marketing lead.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Performance Benchmarks</h2>
            <p>
                We track detailed performance metrics on real-world devices, from high-end laptops to budget Chromebooks. Typical image resize operations complete in under 100ms, and background removal on a 4K photo takes less than a second on modern hardware. Our video processing pipeline leverages multi-threaded WebAssembly to keep CPU usage reasonable.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Developer Story & Open Source</h2>
            <p>
                Image & Video Tools is fully open source under the MIT license. The codebase lives on GitHub, where contributors from around the world submit pull requests, file issues, and suggest enhancements. Our roadmap and design discussions happen in the open, and we welcome anyone to join the project—whether you’re a front-end wizard or writing tests in TypeScript.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Integrations & API</h2>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, we plan to offer a lightweight JavaScript API so other web apps can embed our editing capabilities. Imagine a CMS that lets you crop images inline or a blogging platform that auto-generates video thumbnails on upload. These integrations will be easy to drop into any existing codebase.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Future Roadmap</h2>
            <p>
                Our upcoming features include advanced video trimming with frame-accurate scrubbing, batch operations with queue management, and AI-powered suggestions for color grading and auto-cropping. We’re also exploring a plugin architecture so third parties can add custom effects and filters.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Community & Support</h2>
            <p>
                Join our Discord server for real-time chat, tips, and collaboration. File issues on GitHub for bug reports or feature requests, and check our public roadmap for transparency on planned enhancements. We publish monthly newsletters highlighting new features, community projects, and tutorials.
